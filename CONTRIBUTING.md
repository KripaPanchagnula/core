# Contributing

We will ask you to abide by our [code of conduct](#code-of-conduct) whenever you are contributing to the `@bridge-tools` suite of packages. We will also require that you assign the copyright for any contributions you make to the bridge-tools organisation, where it will be made available under the MIT license. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more information.

## Pull Request Process

This is the general process. For specific packages see below.

The recommended way to contribute to the `@bridge-tools` suite is using vscode with the eslint + prettier extensions with formatOnSave enabled. This will ensure the code is correctly formatted as you write it. If you wish to propose an amendment to the code styling, please create an issue under the `@bridge-tools/config` repository.

1. Fork the package you wish to contribute to.
2. Write the code along with any relevant unit tests.
3. Check that the code builds (`npm run build`), passes the linter (`npm run lint`) and passes the tests (`npm test`).
4. Create a pull request and wait for comments from the `bridge-tools` team.

## Specific package requirements

-   We require 100% code coverage for the `@bridge-tools/core` repository. Pull Requests which do not satisfy this will not be merged and we will ask you to write more tests.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

-   Using welcoming and inclusive language
-   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
-   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
-   Focusing on what is best for the community
-   Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

-   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
    advances
-   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
-   Public or private harassment
-   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
    address, without explicit permission
-   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
    professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at `aaron@bridge-tools.com`. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
